# Hey, I'm Vishva 👋  

I’m a student at the University of Pennsylvania, studying Computer & Information Science (BSE) and **Electrical & Systems Engineering (MSE). I like building things that connect machine learning, distributed systems, and blockchain — from optimizing vehicle routing with neural networks to making ML models shareable on-chain.  

I’ve gotten to work on medical research at Penn, auto finance tech at Capital One, and large-scale telecom systems at RealNetworks — all really different, but each taught me how tech moves from ideas to real-world impact.
